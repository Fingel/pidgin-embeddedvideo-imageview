This repo contains a copy of the pidgin-embeddedvideo plugin, copied over from a tarball into github.

However, instead of the mainline (unmaintained version), this contains a modified copy from:

http://geekr.googlecode.com/files/pidgin-embeddedvideo-imageview.tar.gz
(discovered at http://code.google.com/p/pidgin-embeddedvideo/issues/detail?id=18)

which contains an initial implementation of displaying images within pidgin as well. 

This implementation does not scale the images to the chat window size, so I leave that as a TODO.
